Taking inspiration from the viral tennis cat video, I decided to recreate it using Pygame. You play as the racket and hit the ball back to the cat.

### Installation

1. Install pygame
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/johnf008/cat_tennis_ball.git
   ```
3. Ensure you have an up-to-date version of Python
4. Run the file in an IDE

### Future Updates

1. Understand how to fix Pybag on my computer so I can upload it to itch io
2. Add a TikTok comment section to be another player character
3. Add more cat characters
4. Add a background
5. Apply cooler fonts to the plain text
6. Have the cat launch 2 balls, and have them be at different speeds after reaching a certain score.
7. Have the ball get launched faster
8. Implement a tennis court background

### Why did this project take so much time????
I haven't touched Python in around a year, and this is my first time using the Pygame library. The reason why this took extremely long was that I had to learn how to use Pygame, and I repeatedly had to switch a lot of the code. For example, I had to give the sprites classes, and I encountered a lot of bugs when doing so. In addition, I had to learn to use Figma to create the logo and the cat racket. I know it seems that I didn't spend this much time on a simple project, but I did because of the time I spent learning. 

### Disclaimer
I used many YouTube tutorials to help create this game, so some of this code may seem similar. In addition, I used AI to help me understand the equation I needed to use to increase the scale of the tennis ball as it glided across the screen.
